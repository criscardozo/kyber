// Where is the consumer, and what does it say about itself?
//
// kyber is a git submodule at `<consumer>/kyber/`, so the scripts in here run
// one directory deeper than the copies they replaced. The old
// `resolve(dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), "..")` would now point at
// kyber itself and keep going — writing backups into the submodule, reading a
// firebase.json that does not exist — without ever failing. `git rev-parse
// --show-toplevel` is no better: inside a submodule it answers with the
// submodule's root.
//
// So the consumer root is found by walking UP until a `.kyber/config.json`
// appears, and by failing out loud when none does.
