/**
 * What the arguments mean, decided without touching the process.
 *
 * Separate from `run` so it can be tested: the half that decides is pure, and
 * the half that exits is three lines with nothing to get wrong.
 *
 * Any argument starting with `-` must be declared. Unknown ones are REFUSED
 * rather than ignored, which is not pedantry: a typo'd `--prod` silently
 * ignored means a restore quietly aims at the wrong target, and the run looks
 * exactly like the one that was asked for.
 *
 * Operands are refused too unless the script says how many it takes, and that
 * default is the strict one on purpose — five of the seven scripts here take
 * none, so `backup.mjs production` should not read as `backup.mjs`. The one
 * script that had this check written by hand refused stray operands as well,
 * and moving it to the shared gate had to keep that rather than quietly
 * loosen it.
 *
 * `flags` are switches; `values` are flags that take the next argument, which
 * is then not an operand. The two are declared apart because guessing was
 * wrong: when any declared flag swallowed the argument after it,
 * `restore --production old.json new.json` read `old.json` as the value of
 * `--production`, counted one operand, and ran — restoring `old.json` with
 * `new.json` dropped in silence. A value flag with nothing after it is refused
 * rather than left for the script to discover.

 * bug or a network failure and keeps its stack.
 *
 * The argument gate lives HERE, in the one call every script already makes,
 * rather than in a helper each script has to remember to call. It is here
 * because it was forgotten: `--help` on the backup script ran a full dump
 * against production, reported by a consumer who typed it to find out how to
 * invoke the thing. The same bug had already been fixed once, in the install
 * script, by writing the check into that file — which fixed that file and
 * nothing else. A rule you have to remember at the right moment is the rule
 * that gets skipped; a gate in the shared entry point cannot be.
