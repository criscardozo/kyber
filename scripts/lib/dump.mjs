// The dump format: Firestore values to JSON and back.
//
// Pure functions. The Firestore `Timestamp` class is injected rather than
// imported so that this file — and its tests — run in a bare kyber clone with
// nothing installed; the scripts pass the real one from firebase-admin.
//
// Timestamps are TAGGED (`{"$timestamp": "<ISO>"}`) rather than flattened to a
// string, because the flattened form cannot be checked: a restore writes plain
// strings back, the next dump serialises those to the same characters, and
// comparing dump against dump agrees perfectly while every audit field has
// quietly changed type. A round trip would prove nothing, which is the one
// thing it exists to prove.
//
// Anything else Firestore can hold and no consumer uses — GeoPoint,
// DocumentReference, Bytes — throws instead of being mangled into a shape that
// looks fine in JSON. If one ever appears, the backup stops rather than lying.
// The same goes for NaN and ±Infinity, which Firestore stores as doubles and
// JSON.stringify writes as `null` without a word.
