// Put a backup back. A backup nobody has ever read back is a hope, and the day
// you find out whether it restores is the worst possible day to find out.
//
// Usage, from the consumer:
//   pnpm restore backups/<file>.json
//     → into the local EMULATOR (the consumer's own port, from firebase.json,
//       unless FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST says otherwise). The default on purpose.
//   pnpm restore --production backups/<file>.json
//     → into the real project. Refuses unless the dump names that project AND
//       was read from production, then asks for a typed confirmation.
//
// Every document in the dump is written over whatever is there; documents that
// exist today but are not in the dump are left alone. This restores, it does
// not wipe. A document the dump marks `missing` did not exist when it was
// taken: what was under it is restored, and it is not created.
//
// Reads from .kyber/config.json: projectId, emulatorProjectId, firebaseDir,
// and optionally restore.legacyIsoTimestamps.
